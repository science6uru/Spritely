# About and Features
</p>
<p align="center">
Spritely is a free & open-source tool for Mac & Linux systems to completely automate your spritesheet creation workflow with just a few commands in the terminal. 

Features include:

- Recounting folders of images to a usable amount (Evenly spaced)

- Cropping all images in a folder to the max without cutting images / alpha off (crops all images evenly based on combined maximum dimensions)

- Previewing spritesheet as a .GIF File (Not pre-made spritesheets, only prepared ones are supported as of now)

- Arranging a folder of any amount of images into a usable spritesheet (Customizable grid specifications)

- Allows to add padding to a whole image folder
    
- And much more to come...

# Installation and Setup
First, if you haven't already, you will need to install Homebrew & ImageMagick. If you do not need homebrew you can skip ahead to step 2.
